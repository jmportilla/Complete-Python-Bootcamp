    "#Nested Statements and Scope \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have gone over on writing our own functions, its important to understand how Python deals with the variable names you assign. When you create a variable name in Python the name is stored in a *namespace*. Variable names also have a *scope*, the scope determines the visbility of that variable name to other parts of your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "This idea of scope in your code is very important to understand in order to properly assign and call variable names. \n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms, the idea of scope can be described by 3 general rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Name assignments will create or change local names by default.\n",
    "2. Name references search (at most) four scopes:\n",
    "    * local\n",
    "    * any enclosing functions\n",
    "    * global\n",
    "    * built-in\n",
    "3. Names declared in global and nonlocal statements map assigned names to enclosing module        and function scopes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**LEGB Rule.**\n",
    "\n",
    "L: Local — Names assigned in any way within a function (def or lambda)), and not declared global in that function.\n",
    "\n",
    "E: Enclosing function locals — Name in the local scope of any and all enclosing functions (def or lambda), from inner to outer.\n",
    "\n",
    "G: Global (module) — Names assigned at the top-level of a module file, or declared global in a def within the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "B: Built-in (Python) — Names preassigned in the built-in names module : open,range,SyntaxError,..."

    "##Local Variables\n",
    "When you declare variables inside a function definition, they are not related in any way to other variables with the same names used outside the function - i.e. variable names are local to the function. This is called the scope of the variable. All variables have the scope of the block they are declared in starting from the point of definition of the name.\n",

    "The first time that we print the value of the name x with the first line in the function’s body, Python uses the value of the parameter declared in the main block, above the function definition.\n",

    "\n",
    "##The global statement\n",
    "If you want to assign a value to a name defined at the top level of the program (i.e. not inside any kind of scope such as functions or classes), then you have to tell Python that the name is not local, but it is global. We do this using the global statement. It is impossible to assign a value to a variable defined outside a function without the global statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the values of such variables defined outside the function (assuming there is no variable with the same name within the function). However, this is not encouraged and should be avoided since it becomes unclear to the reader of the program as to where that variable’s definition is. Using the global statement makes it amply clear that the variable is defined in an outermost block.\n",
